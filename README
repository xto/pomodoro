DISCLAIMER

This is a work in progress. I'm working on this on weekends and evenings. It's not ready to use yet...
I decided to let go of the GUI for now. Once it's working through a CLI, I'll start messing with GTK/QT...


Pomodoro Timer

I've read about the pomodoro technique a little while ago. I figured it'd be a cool way to try out a fully BDD (Behavior Driven Development) project. Read more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development and http://behaviour-driven.org/ 
If you've got any question with the awesome time management technique that is teh Pomodoro technique, please refer to this website : http://www.pomodorotechnique.com
